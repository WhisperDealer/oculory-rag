# Cut a GitHub release

## Resolve the repo and asset names first — never hardcode them

```bash
REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq .nameWithOwner)
```

Pass `-R "$REPO"` to every `gh` call so it works regardless of the local remote name.

The release assets are whatever `build/build.ps1` produces — one `.7z` per release in
`build/manifest.json`. Read the names from the manifest rather than assuming:

```bash
python -c "import json;print('\n'.join(r['archiveName']+'.7z' for r in json.load(open('build/manifest.json'))['releases']))"
```

GitHub replaces spaces with dots in uploaded asset filenames, so a manifest `archiveName` of
`Example Mod` arrives as `Example.Mod.7z`. Confirm the actual names with
`gh release view vX.Y.Z -R "$REPO" --json assets --jq '.assets[].name'` once the release exists.

## Background: how CI releases work

Pushing a **`v*` tag** is the only thing that publishes. `.github/workflows/build.yml` builds every
archive on that tag and creates the GitHub Release with `--generate-notes`, attaching each `.7z`.

Pushes to `main` build as a smoke test but publish nothing, and PRs attach their archives as
throwaway Actions artifacts. So a release is: **tag → wait for CI → curate the notes.**

## Steps

### 1. Establish the version and the previous tag

- Confirm the new version with the user (e.g. `v1.2.0`) if not given. Follow semver off the last
  version tag: `gh release list -R "$REPO" --limit 100`.
- The previous version tag (`PREV`) is the newest `vX.Y.Z` release — this is the changelog base.

### 2. Sync and inspect the changes

```bash
git fetch --all --tags
git pull --ff-only          # get main to origin tip
git log --oneline --no-merges PREV..HEAD
```

Read the meaningful commits and group them for the changelog (plugin/record changes, scripts,
FOMOD/installer, CI). **Call out which plugins actually changed** — for a multi-plugin repo, users
care whether the main mod moved or whether this is a patches-only release.

### 3. Check the commit you are about to tag is green

The tag build is the release build, so a red `main` means a failed release, not a bad asset:

```bash
gh run list -R "$REPO" --workflow build.yml --branch main --limit 3
```

If the newest `main` run failed, fix that before tagging.

### 4. Write the changelog notes

Write a `notes.md` in a scratch dir. Structure it with `##` sections, lead with a one-line framing
of what the release is mainly about, and end with:

```
**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/<REPO>/compare/PREV...vX.Y.Z
```

### 5. Tag it — this publishes

Confirm the version and the expected asset list with the user first: pushing the tag is what makes
the release public.

```bash
git tag vX.Y.Z
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

Then watch the build that cuts the release:

```bash
gh run list -R "$REPO" --workflow build.yml --limit 3          # find the run for the tag
gh run watch <runId> -R "$REPO" --exit-status
```

### 6. Replace the generated notes and mark it Latest

CI creates the release with auto-generated notes. Overwrite them with the curated changelog:

```bash
gh release edit vX.Y.Z -R "$REPO" --notes-file notes.md --latest
```

### 7. Verify

```bash
gh release view vX.Y.Z -R "$REPO" --json assets,isLatest,isDraft \
  --jq '{latest:.isLatest, draft:.isDraft, assets:[.assets[].name]}'
```

Confirm the release is `Latest`, not a draft, and that every archive from `build/manifest.json` is
attached. Report the release URL to the user.

## Notes / gotchas

- **A failed tag build leaves the tag but no release.** Delete the tag before retrying, or the
  re-push is a no-op: `git push origin :refs/tags/vX.Y.Z && git tag -d vX.Y.Z`.
- **Don't build locally and upload by hand.** Let the tag build produce the assets; a local Spriggit
  deserialize can drift from what CI ships. Only fall back to a manual build if the user explicitly
  asks.
- Keep asset filenames exactly as CI produced them — that's what users and any install instructions
  expect.
- Publishing a release is **outward-facing and hard to reverse**. Confirm the version number and the
  asset list with the user before pushing the tag in step 5.
