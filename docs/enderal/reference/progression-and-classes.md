# Progression, memory trees and classes

Enderal replaces Skyrim's progression wholesale. Nothing here is vanilla behaviour with different
numbers — it is a different system implemented in Papyrus on top of the same engine.

**Primary source:** `_00E_Game_SkillmenuSC` (`_00e_game_skillmenusc.psc`, 1082 lines),
`_00E_EPUpdateFunctions` (`_00e_epupdatefunctions.psc`), `_00E_TalentLibrary`. All **[verified]**.

## No learning by doing

Skills do not rise from use. Enderal runs its own XP curve and hands out points you spend manually.

`_00E_EPUpdateFunctions` owns it, via these globals **[verified]**:

| Global | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `PlayerExp` | current experience |
| `PlayerLevel` | current level |
| `PlayerNeededExp` | XP required for the next level |
| `EXPMult`, `EXPMultSlope` | curve shape, fed to `ComputeNeededExp(CurrentLevel, Slope, Mult)` |

```papyrus
float Function ComputeNeededExp(int CurrentLevel, float Slope, float Mult)
```

> **Patch note.** Anything that grants vanilla XP, or expects `Game.IncrementSkillBy` / skill-use
> advancement to matter, does nothing useful in Enderal. If a combat mod rewards "skill increases",
> it is rewarding a currency Enderal doesn't spend.

## Three separate point currencies

This is the part most often got wrong. They are **not** interchangeable and they are spent in
different places. **[verified]**

| Currency | Global | Spent on |
|---|---|---|
| **Learning Points** | `Lernpunkte` | raising *skills* (One-Handed, Alchemy, …) |
| **Crafting Points** | `Handwerkspunkte` | raising *crafting* skills |
| **Memory Points** | `TalentPoints` | buying *perks* in the memory trees |

The German names are the real property names in the source — `Lernpunkte` is Learning Points,
`Handwerkspunkte` is Crafting Points. Do not "fix" them.

### Memory Points are mirrored into a vanilla ActorValue

```papyrus
TalentPoints.SetValue(TalentPoints.GetValueInt() + 1)
Game.GetPlayer().SetAV("dragonsouls", TalentPoints.GetValueInt())
```

**[verified]**, appears in `_00e_class_perkscript.psc`, `_00e_erinnerungslehrbuch.psc`,
`_00e_lehrbuch_plus1memorypointsc.psc` and others. `TalentPoints` is authoritative; `DragonSouls` is
a display mirror. **If you grant memory points, you must update both** or the UI desyncs from the
real total. See [`scripting-and-actorvalues.md`](scripting-and-actorvalues.md) for the full list of
repurposed ActorValues.

## The memory trees

There are **11 perk trees** plus index 0 reserved for "no class". Registration, in order, from
`_00E_Game_SkillmenuSC.InitAffinitySystem()` **[verified]**:

| Index | Tree (code name) | Perk FormList | Perks |
|---:|---|---|---:|
| 0 | *(no class)* | `None` | — |
| 1 | Bastion | `BastionPerks` `06686B:Skyrim.esm` | 22 |
| 2 | Derwish *(Bladedancer)* | `DerwishPerks` `06686D:Skyrim.esm` | 22 |
| 3 | Elementalism | `ElementalismPerks` `066875:Skyrim.esm` | — |
| 4 | Espionage *(Infiltrator)* | `EspionagePerks` `066889:Skyrim.esm` | 20 |
| 5 | LifeAndDeath *(Sinistrope)* | `LifeAndDeathPerks` `066873:Skyrim.esm` | 23 |
| 6 | Manipulation *(Thaumaturge)* | `ManipulationPerks` `06686A:Skyrim.esm` | 21 |
| 7 | Rage *(Vandal)* | `RagePerks` `066887:Skyrim.esm` | 22 |
| 8 | Trickery *(Rogue)* | `TrickeryPerks` `06687F:Skyrim.esm` | 21 |
| 9 | Vagabond *(Vagrant)* | `VagabondPerks` `066877:Skyrim.esm` | 23 |
| 10 | Phasmalist **(FS only)** | `FS_PhasmalistPerks` `044EEA:Skyrim.esm` | — |
| 11 | Theriantrophist **(FS only)** | `FS_TheriantrophistPerks` `02EE04:Enderal - Forgotten Stories.esm` | — |

Trees 10 and 11 are registered **only when Forgotten Stories is active**
(`_00E_FS_IsForgottenStoriesActivated == 1`); otherwise their indices are set but no FormList is
bound. **[verified]**

Each tree also has parallel **Talents** and **Words** FormLists — e.g. `ElementalismTalents`
`06686F:Skyrim.esm`, `ElementalismWords` `06687E:Skyrim.esm`. **[verified]** All nine base trees have
the full triple.

> **To add a perk to a tree, you must add it to that tree's FormList.** A Perk record that is not in
> a `*Perks` FormList is invisible to the menu — `GetPerkDistribution()` counts points by walking
> those FormLists. Creating the Perk alone does nothing, and nothing warns you.

## Affinities (hybrid classes)

Once you have invested enough in two trees, you unlock an **affinity** — a hybrid class granted as an
ability **Spell** (`_00E_Affinity_Ab*`). There are 21 affinity slots.

### The unlock rule, exactly

```papyrus
Function TryUnlockAffinity(Int[] PerkDistribution, Int iAffinity, int iMainPerk, \
                           int iSecondaryPerk1, int iSecondaryPerk2 = 0, int iSecondaryPerk3 = 0)
    If PerkDistribution[iMainPerk] >= 10 && Affinity_Spells[iAffinity]
        If PerkDistribution[iSecondaryPerk1] >= 10 || PerkDistribution[iSecondaryPerk2] >= 10 \
           || PerkDistribution[iSecondaryPerk3] >= 10
            affinitiesUnlocked[iAffinity] = True
```

**≥10 points in the main tree AND ≥10 in at least one listed secondary tree.** **[verified]**

### The affinity table

Straight from `UpdateUnlockedAffinities()` **[verified]**. "Main" is the required tree; any one
"secondary" satisfies the second condition.

| Affinity | Main tree | Secondary (any one) |
|---|---|---|
| Battlemage | Elementalism | Derwish / Rage / Bastion |
| Cleric | Manipulation | Bastion / Rage |
| Assassin | Espionage | Derwish |
| Wayfarer | Vagabond | Trickery |
| Black Mage | LifeAndDeath | Elementalism |
| Dark Keeper | LifeAndDeath | Bastion |
| Fencer *(Blademaster)* | Derwish | Rage |
| Bladebreaker | Derwish | Bastion |
| Shadowdancer | Espionage | LifeAndDeath |
| Wandering Mage | Vagabond | Elementalism / Manipulation |
| Arcane Archer | Trickery | Elementalism / Manipulation / LifeAndDeath |
| Ritualist *(Spectralist)* | Phasmalist | LifeAndDeath |
| Spectral Warrior | Phasmalist | Rage / Bastion / Derwish |
| Ghostblade | Phasmalist | Espionage / Trickery |
| Brute | Theriantrophist | Derwish / Rage |
| Drifter | Theriantrophist | Vagabond |
| Druid | Theriantrophist | Elementalism |
| Nightwolf | Theriantrophist | Espionage |
| Ravager | Theriantrophist | LifeAndDeath |

The source comments carry the German names (`Klingentänzer`, `Schwarzmagier`, `Vielgereister`, …) —
useful when matching against in-game German text. Wandering Mage is marked
*"currently not implemented"* in the source. **[verified]**

When more than one affinity is available the player is asked to choose
(`AskForAffinityFS` / `AskForAffinityOld`, branching on
`_00E_FS_IsForgottenStoriesActivated`). **[verified]**

## Talents are three-tier perk + WordOfPower sets

`_00E_TalentLibrary` is the read-back helper **[verified]**:

```papyrus
int Function GetPlayerTalentLevel(Perk Perk01, Perk Perk02, Perk Perk03) Global
    if Player.HasPerk(Perk03)
        return 3
    ElseIf ((Player.HasPerk(Perk02)) && !(Player.HasPerk(Perk03)))
        return 2
    ...

int Function GetTalentLevel(WordOfPower Word01, WordOfPower Word02, WordOfPower Word03) Global
    if Game.IsWordUnlocked(Word03)
        return 3
    ...
```

So a talent is **three Perk records plus three WordOfPower records**, and its "level" is derived by
asking which tier the player has. The naming convention makes them easy to find:
`_00E_Class_Phasmalist_P03_Talent_SummonApparation_01/_02/_03` paired with
`_00E_A3_Phasmalist_SummonApparation1/2/3`. **[verified]**

Enderal SE ships 41 Shouts and 85 WordsOfPower in base, 15 and 42 more in FS — talents are delivered
through the **shout/word machinery**, not through a bespoke system.

## The character menu is drawn by Papyrus

`_00E_Game_SkillmenuSC` extends **ReferenceAlias**, registers for `"Journal Menu"`, and listens on
`OnKeyDown` with configurable keycodes (`iExitHeroMenuKeycode1 = 15` TAB,
`iExitHeroMenuKeycode2 = 1` ESC). **[verified]**

Consequences for patching:

1. **Perks added to vanilla Skyrim perk trees are unreachable.** Enderal never draws the vanilla
   tree. The player cannot see or buy them. This is the single most common way a ported Skyrim
   combat mod silently does nothing.
2. **To be buyable, a perk must be in a `*Perks` FormList** bound to a registered tree.
3. **To be granted without being bought**, hang it off a MGEF `PerkToApply`, a script `AddPerk`, or
   an affinity ability spell instead — and say so in the patch's notes.
4. The class shown to the player comes from `GetPlayerClassName()`: the affinity name if one is
   active, otherwise `Major / Minor` tree names. **[verified]**

## Where points come from

Beyond levelling: skill books and quest rewards. Examples **[verified]**:

| Script | Effect |
|---|---|
| `_00E_Lehrbuch_Plus1MemoryPointSC` | +1 Memory Point |
| `_00E_Lehrbuch_Plus2SkillPointsScript` | +2 Learning Points |
| `_00E_Erinnerungslehrbuch` | memory-book grant |
| `_00E_Handwerksbuch*` (Speechcraft 25/50/75/100) | crafting/skill books at thresholds |
| `_00E_FS_A3_TalentBookSC`, `_00E_FS_NQR05_TharaelTalentBookSC` | FS talent books |

`_00E_TalentBookAchievementUnlocked` (`02ED7B:Enderal - Forgotten Stories.esm`) tracks the related
achievement. **[verified]**

## Mana is small, fixed, and spell costs are authored against it

**[verified 2026-09-01]** The player's maximum mana comes from one place: the level-up prompt in
`_00e_epupdatefunctions.psc`, which offers **+9 Health, +8 Mana or +11 Stamina** and grants exactly
one of the three.

```papyrus
int iMessage = _00E_Levelup.show(PlayerLevel.GetValueInt(), Player.GetBaseAV("Health"), ...)
...
elseif iMessage == 1
    Player.SetActorValue("Magicka", Player.GetBaseAV("Magicka")+8)
```

So a mage who spends **every** level on mana and never takes a point of health ends a normal
playthrough somewhere near **400–500** — 100 to start plus 8 a level. There is no learn-by-doing
multiplier and no per-school pool. That single number is what every spell in the game is priced
against.

### The authored cost bands

A `SPELL` record's `BaseCost` is only what the game charges when the `ManualCostCalc` flag is set.
Without it the engine recomputes at runtime from the effects — `MGEF.BaseCost * magnitude^1.1 *
(duration / 10)^1.1`, summed. **Enderal does not use that**: 271 of the 274 spells its own tomes
teach carry the flag, so SureAI typed every cost by hand. (The exceptions are
`_00E_SpellFireExtinguisherMQ04` and the two ranks of Silence, and Silence Rank II's **309** is the
most expensive Apprentice-tier spell in the game precisely because nobody typed it.)

Measured over those authored spells, keyed by tier through the vanilla school perk in
`HalfCostPerk`:

| Tier | n | min | p25 | med | p75 | max |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Novice | 51 | 6 | 14 | 21 | 38 | 140 |
| Apprentice | 52 | 12 | 27 | 40 | 55 | 140 |
| Adept | 51 | 10 | 34 | 55 | 80 | 200 |
| Expert | 57 | 29 | 49 | 65 | 110 | 260 |
| Master | 38 | 38 | 68 | 80 | 170 | **310** |

Two things to read off it. The curve is **flat** — a master spell is under four times a novice one,
where Skyrim's ladder is closer to twenty — and **310 is the ceiling for the whole game**
(`_60E_FS_Mystical_SummonAtrocity` at 315 is the only thing above it, and it is not tome-taught).
Against a 400–500 pool that ceiling is about half a maxed mage's bar, which is the design: the most
expensive thing in Enderal is castable twice.

Talents discount from there. All three class lines cover the full tier ladder through
`SpellHasCastingPerkConditionData` — `_00E_Class_Elementalist_P02/P05/P07/P09`,
`_00E_Class_Sinistrope_P02/P05/P06/P07/P09` and `_00E_Class_Thaumaturge_P02/P05/P07/P09`, with
`ModSpellCost` values of 0.65–0.7 at the top. So a master-tier spell a specialised mage has fully
invested in still bills roughly two-thirds of its `BaseCost`.

> **Consequence for a ported spell mod.** Its costs are almost certainly auto-calculated, and the
> duration term inflates long buffs and summons out of all proportion — Apocalypse's Conjure
> Battlemage was a 50-cost effect with a 180 s duration and billed **1201**. Set `ManualCostCalc`
> and author the number. See CLAUDE.md, "A ported spell's MANA COST is computed by the engine".

## Checklist for a progression-touching patch

- [ ] Does the perk exist in a `*Perks` FormList bound to a registered tree? If not, how does the
      player get it?
- [ ] If you grant Memory Points, do you set **both** `TalentPoints` and the `DragonSouls` AV?
- [ ] Are you changing affinity thresholds? They are hardcoded at `>= 10` in
      `_00E_Game_SkillmenuSC` — a data-only patch cannot change them.
- [ ] Does your change assume vanilla XP or learn-by-doing? It won't fire.
- [ ] Have you tested with **and** without Forgotten Stories active? Trees 10/11 register
      conditionally.
