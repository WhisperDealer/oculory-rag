# Apocalypse for Enderal -- spell test matrix

> **Generated** by `src/Apocalypse/tools/13-gen-test-matrix.ps1` from the Spriggit YAML. Do not
> hand-edit -- re-run it. Tick the boxes in a working copy or a PR comment.

Covers every obtainable item this release ships: **175 tome spells** and **144 scrolls**.
(`WB_SecretChest_Note` is a note, not a tome, and is excluded.)

## Before you start

**1. Find the plugin's load-order index.** It is not knowable from the repo. In the console:

```
help "Spell Tome: Alarm" 0
```

It prints something like `BOOK: 0703C517 'Spell Tome: Alarm'`. The leading **two hex digits** are
the index -- `07` here. **If this returns nothing, stop:** the plugin is not loading at all, which
on Enderal almost always means the `HEDR` form version is 1.71 rather than 1.70.

**2. Generate the batch files** with that index (this doc currently shows `XX`):

```
powershell -File src/Apocalypse/tools/13-gen-test-matrix.ps1 -ModIndex 07
```

Copy the resulting `apoc-*.txt` into Enderal's game root (beside `SkyrimSE.exe`) and run e.g.
`bat apoc-elementalism` in the console.

**3. Set up a test character.** `tgm` for god mode, `player.setav magicka 100000`,
`player.setlevel 50` so level-gated distribution is live, and `player.advskill destruction 100000`
(repeat per school) so skill-scaled magnitudes read true.

**4. Turn on the Papyrus log.** [verified 2026-08-07] Under MO2 the INI the game reads is the
**profile's**, not the one in `Documents` -- `settings.ini` has `LocalSettings=true`. So edit
`<modlist>\profiles\<profile>\Enderal.ini`, `[Papyrus]` section:

```
bEnableLogging=1
bEnableTrace=1
bEnableProfiling=0
```

`bEnableTrace` is the one that matters -- the lines you are looking for are `Debug.Trace` calls
and they are suppressed without it. Leave profiling off; it is a heavy frame cost.

The log then appears at

```
Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition\Logs\Script\Papyrus.0.log
```

**Skyrim's folder, not Enderal's** -- the same quirk that puts the SKSE and crash logs there,
confirmed on this machine. Turn both settings back to `0` when you are done; a long session with
logging on produces a very large file.

## Must-pass gate

Nothing below is worth doing until these are green. Each is one launch.

> **PASSED in full on 2026-08-07**, over two sessions, against the build in this branch. The list
> stays here because it has to be re-run on any Apocalypse version bump or record change -- treat
> the ticks as a record of that run, not as permanently true.

- [x] Enderal starts with the rebuilt `.esp` installed and enabled.
- [x] No new crash log in `Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition\SKSE\` -- **not** Enderal's
      folder, which only holds INIs and saves. If there is one, `PLUGINS: Total:` must be non-zero;
      `Total: 0` means the crash happened during file loading, so suspect the header, not records.
- [x] `help "Spell Tome: Alarm" 0` returns a hit (the plugin is not form-version-invisible).
- [x] **NAVI strip -- three specific places, not a general sweep.** See "Testing the NAVI strip"
      below. Ark and Riverville are *not* the test; the removed data never named a navmesh in
      either. *All three checked, no issues.*
- [x] **Brawl / intimidate dialogue behaves as base Enderal does** (it should do nothing special).
      This is the test of the loose `dgintimidate*` stubs. Confirm the mod sits *below* Apocalypse
      in MO2's file order, or its BSA wins and the stubs never load.
- [x] Start a new game, wait 90 seconds, then read the Papyrus log (see below). **Zero**
      `Cannot call AddForm() on a None object` errors. The four `APOCALYPSE DEBUG:` trace lines
      are expected and fine -- the script still runs, it just has nothing to iterate now.
      *Confirmed: 0 in the whole log, down from 685.*
- [x] Open Apocalypse's MCM and press **Repopulate**. Same expectation: traces yes, `AddForm`
      errors no. It runs the identical loop against its own six `_Replenish` FormLists, so it is
      a separate path from the automatic one and has to be checked separately.
- [x] All six merchants stock Apocalypse tomes (see the shop table below).
- [x] `player.additem XX1C1E71 5` ... `XX1C1E75 5` each yield Apocalypse tomes, and
      `player.additem XX1C1E76 10` yields Apocalypse scrolls. `additem` resolves a leveled
      list on the spot, so this proves loot distribution without waiting out `iDaysToRespawnVendor: 2`.

### Testing the NAVI strip

An earlier draft of this checklist said "walk around Ark and Riverville and watch the NPCs". That
was a guess, and resolving the removed record against Enderal shows it is the wrong test:

| What was removed | Could it affect Enderal? |
|---|---|
| 10 vanilla `MapInfos` entries | **No.** Every one parents to worldspace `00003C` -- Tamriel in Skyrim, **`MQP01Home`** in Enderal. And **0 of their 71 distinct FormIDs** is a navmesh Enderal defines |
| `PreferredPathing`, 6,312 refs | **Almost no.** Of 650 distinct FormIDs, **exactly 1** (`075393`) is a real Enderal navmesh |

So 720 of 721 distinct FormIDs in that record named navmeshes that do not exist here -- the engine
had nothing to apply them to. Ark and Riverville were never named at all. **Treat this as a
regression check, not a fix confirmation: the expected result everywhere is "no difference".**

The three places worth actually visiting, in order of value:

- [ ] **`coc WB_Entomb_Cell`** and **`coc WB_Dreamscape_Cell`** -- Apocalypse's own interior cells,
      whose three NAVI entries we **kept**. This is the only place the strip could have *broken*
      something, so it matters more than anything we removed. In each: cast an Entropy summon
      (`bat apoc-entropy` gives you the school), walk to the far side of the cell, and confirm the
      summon **walks** after you rather than standing still or teleporting. Entomb is also reachable
      naturally -- `player.addspell XX04581C`, cast it at an NPC, then cast again to free them; the
      target should walk out under its own power.
- [ ] **`cow Vyn -8 -3`** -- the single unnamed exterior cell whose navmesh (`075393`) the removed
      `PreferredPathing` block actually named. Summon something (`bat apoc-entropy` gives you the
      whole school) and confirm it follows you across the cell and over its boundaries.
- [ ] **`cow MQP01Home 0 0`** -- the worldspace all 10 removed entries parented to. Nothing of
      Enderal's should have changed here, but it is the one worldspace that was named.

**How to read "pathing works".** Standing NPCs prove nothing -- an idle NPC with no package looks
identical to one that cannot path. Use something that must move continuously:

- A **summon or follower** is the sharpest instrument. It re-paths constantly. Repeated
  teleport-to-catch-up, or a summon that spawns and then never closes distance, is the failure.
- **Combat** second: a hostile that will not approach, or circles without closing, is a navmesh
  problem rather than an AI one. `tcai` off and on again to confirm it is pathing and not fleeing.
- Walking into walls, refusing to cross a cell boundary, or sinking through the floor are the
  unambiguous signs.

### Log lines that are expected, not bugs

Seen on a clean run [verified 2026-08-07]. Do not chase these:

```
Error: Property MagicAllegianceFaction on script QF_WBA_Dominate_Quest_0200DBCB attached to
  WB_EnslaveTheWeak_Quest (..00DBCB) cannot be bound because <nullptr form> (0009E0C9) is not
  the right type
Error: Element of property WB_VendorChest on script wb_newmanager_quest_script attached to
  WB_NewManager_Quest (..08095C) ... <nullptr form> ... is not the right type          x4
```

Both are audit findings showing up at runtime: `09E0C9` is the missing allegiance faction behind
the Psionics simulacrum spells, and `WB_NewManager_Quest` binds six missing forms -- the College
of Winterhold ritual quests and books (`0D0755`, `0CD987`, `0FDE76`, `0FDE73`) and two vendor
chests (`098BAC`, `098B9F`) -- for content Enderal has no home for. All of them bind once at load
and cost nothing after.

One more, from actually casting Entomb:

```
Error:  (00051181): does not have 3d and cannot have an effect shader played on it.
stack:
  [ (..00AB5A)].EffectShader.Play() - "<native>"
  [WB_Entomb_Quest].wb_entomb_quest_script.ReleaseCurrentVictim()
  [ (FF00084A)].WB_Entomb_Activator_Script.OnLoad()
```

`ReleaseCurrentVictim()` plays a shader on the freed victim without checking `Is3DLoaded()` first,
so releasing someone whose cell is not loaded logs this once and carries on. Enai's own script,
unrelated to the conversion. Harmless -- the victim is still released.

## The shops

| `coc` target | Shop | Gold | Tier | Tomes | Hook |
|---|---|---:|---|---:|---|
| `CapitalCityMagierkram` | Ark -- Emberlord and Fireflash | 1800 | Master | 45 | `GabrielleFunkenfrst_CustomMerchandise` |
| `SuntempleAlchemy` | Sun Temple -- Torius Flameling | 1430 | Expert | 39 | `TuriousFlammentrunk_CustomMerchandise` |
| `UndercityBarracks2Barnabas` | Undercity -- Barnabas | 1050 | Adept (Mentalism/Entropy/Elementalism) | 19 | `Barnabas_CustomMerchandise` |
| -- | Ark -- Ora Stonehand | 980 | Adept (Psionics/Light Magic) | 14 | `OraSteinschlag_CustomMerchandise` |
| -- | Riverville -- Tarhutie | 630 | Apprentice | 28 | `Tarhutie_CustomMerchandise` |
| -- | Ark -- Milbert Foxhand | 530 | Novice | 15 | `MilbertFuchshand_CustomMerchandise` |

The three shops without a `coc` target are outdoor Ark and Riverville market stalls -- their chests
are placed in `CapitalCityMarketArea`, `CapitalCityStrangerArea` and `Vyn` rather than an interior.

The stock lives in each merchant's `*_CustomMerchandise` hook, not in the chest. Those are SureAI's
own empty `UseAll` LeveledItems -- one per merchant, already inside the chest -- so **this
conversion overrides no container record of any master**, and nothing it sells can be reverted by
an overhaul that rewrites the chest.

Vendor stock is cached in the save (`iDaysToRespawnVendor: 2`), so a merchant only re-rolls every
two in-game days. Sleeping three days is the reliable way to force a restock.

## Risk flags

Auto-derived from `verify-missing-refs.ps1`. A flag is **not** proof the spell is broken -- it says
this row is where to look first, and what to look at.

| Flag | Means | What to check |
|---|---|---|
| `DEAD-PERK` | An effect applies a vanilla perk Enderal does not have (`Disintegrate 0F3F0E`, `Deep Freeze 0F3933`, `Intense Flames 0F392E`, `0153D2`, Illusion `059B76`) | The spell's main effect should work; the rider will not fire. Confirm the base damage/effect still lands |
| `RESPITE-INERT` | Gated on `Respite 0581F9`, which exists in Enderal but is on no perk tree and not on the `Player` record | The Stamina half of a heal never fires. Health restore is the real number |
| `DEAD-SCRIPT-PROP` | A script property points at a missing form. Usually the harmless vanilla helpers (`SayOnHitByMagicEffectScript.TopicToSay`, `MG01FireEffectScript.MG01`) | Watch `Papyrus.0.log` while casting. Errors are expected to be noise; a spell that does nothing is not |
| `VANILLA-LIST` | Behaviour depends on a FormList with dangling entries | Does the spell find or affect anything at all |
| `SUMMON-GAP` | Summons an actor whose gear, perks or death item are missing | Does the summon appear, is it hostile, does it have a weapon |
| `MISSING-EFFECT` | An effect record the spell references does not exist | Almost certainly broken. Investigate before shipping |
| `NOT-SOLD` | Stocked by no merchant and in no leveled list -- unobtainable by design (the 15 Daedric/Dwemer summons) | Confirm it is genuinely unreachable, then skip the row |

The walk stops one hop past the spell's magic effects. Going further flagged a third more rows
without reaching anything new, so what lies deeper is listed by hand below instead.

### Suggested order

The must-pass gate is green, so what remains is the rows. They are not equally worth your time --
of the 319 rows:

| Do | Rows | Why |
|---|---:|---|
| **1. Flagged rows** | 54 | The audit says something they touch is missing. Highest chance of finding a real defect per cast |
| **2. The "Known gaps" list below** | ~18 | Locate Object's ten modes, Control Weather, the six simulacrum spells. Hand-found, so no flag marks them |
| **3. NOT-SOLD rows** | 21 | Not casts at all -- one merchant sweep confirms a player cannot reach them |
| **4. Everything else** | 244 | The bulk. Lowest yield per row; batch it by school |

**Leave Papyrus logging on for the whole run.** A spell that silently does nothing looks the same
as one that works if you are only watching the screen, and the log is what tells them apart. Cast
through a school with `bat apoc-<school>`, then afterwards:

```
grep -nE "Error|cannot|None" Papyrus.0.log | grep -i "WB_"
```

That turns 35 casts into one thing to read, and it catches the failures an eye test misses.

## Known gaps the flags do not reach

Found by reading the records, not by the scan. Test these deliberately.

- [ ] **Locate Object** (`XX00C143`, Mentalism Adept) is one spell that cycles ten categories, each
      driven by its own quest and inclusion/exclusion FormList. Those lists are vanilla base objects,
      and Enderal kept some and dropped others, so the modes do not stand or fall together:
  - [ ] **Ore vein** -- expected to WORK. Its inclusion list resolves to 561 live Activators,
        including Enderal's own `_00E_MineOreShadowsteel`.
  - [ ] **Plant** -- expected to WORK. Resolves to live `TreeFlora*` records, e.g.
        `TreeFloraVatyrsTongue01`.
  - [ ] **Potion** -- expected to FAIL. `WB_AlterationAlt_FormList_LocatePotion_Inclusion` is
        7 entries and **all 7 are missing** from Enderal. There is nothing it can match.
  - [ ] **Written text** -- partly dead: the word-wall FormList has a dangling entry.
  - [ ] Gold, container, door, key, soul gem, mineral, equipment -- unverified either way. Note
        which find something and which do not.
- [ ] **The `Locate Container` exclusion list is 68-for-68 dangling.** It is an *exclusion*, so the
      failure mode is over-matching (highlighting containers it should skip), not silence.
- [ ] **Control Weather** (Mentalism Master) backs up and restores the active weather through
      FormLists, and two of its script properties point at missing vanilla records
      (`MAGProjectileStormVar 101DAB`, `MQClearSkyFogSpell 10387F`). Enderal replaces every weather
      setting, so cast it, then confirm the weather **returns to normal** afterwards rather than
      sticking. Watch cutscene fades for a while after -- they are a known casualty of weather
      meddling in Enderal.
- [ ] **The Psionics simulacrum line.** Six effects run six different scripts
      (`WB_EvilTwin_Script`, `WB_EvilTwinAtTarget_Script`, `WB_SeidstoneHazard_Script`,
      `WB_PullFromEternity_Script`, `WB_Warband_Script`) but every one takes a
      `MagicAllegianceFaction` property pointing at `09E0C9`, which Enderal does not have. That
      covers **Pale Shadow, Evil Twin, Fold Into Ether, Seidstone, Pull From Eternity** and
      **Spectral Warband**. Check the summoned copy is **friendly and follows**, not hostile or
      inert. `Compelling Whispers` reads the same property from its proc effect -- check the
      charmed target actually fights for you.

## Known-unobtainable by design

Fifteen Daedric and Dwemer summons are stocked by no merchant and in no leveled list, following the
`enderal-magic-porter` rule that Daedra and Dwemer have no place in Enderal's setting. Their
records still ship (removing them would break every FormList and script that indexes them), so
they are flagged `NOT-SOLD` above rather than deleted. Nothing to test -- but verify a player
cannot reach them:

- [ ] `WB_Con_Dremora4_Spell_ConjureDremoraChampion_NPC` -- **Conjure Entropic Champion** is not offered by any merchant and does not drop
- [ ] `WB_Con_Dremora2_Spell_ConjureDremoraChurl_NPC` -- **Conjure Entropic Churl** is not offered by any merchant and does not drop
- [ ] `WB_Con_Dremora4_Spell_ConjureDremoraHonorGuard_NPC` -- **Conjure Entropic Honor Guard** is not offered by any merchant and does not drop
- [ ] `WB_Con_Dremora4_Spell_ConjureDremoraMentor` -- **Conjure Entropic Mentor** is not offered by any merchant and does not drop
- [ ] `WB_Con_Dremora3_Spell_ConjureDremoraPitFighter_NPC` -- **Conjure Entropic Pit Fighter** is not offered by any merchant and does not drop
- [ ] `WB_Con_Daedric5_Spell_ConjureKyrkrim` -- **Conjure Kyrkrim** is not offered by any merchant and does not drop
- [ ] `WB_Con_Dremora5_Spell_ConjureLordOfBindings_NPC` -- **Conjure Lord of Bindings** is not offered by any merchant and does not drop
- [ ] `WB_Con_Xivilai4_Spell_ConjureXivilaiLord_NPC` -- **Conjure Sinistran Lord** is not offered by any merchant and does not drop
- [ ] `WB_Con_Xivilai3_Spell_ConjureXivilaiSorcerer_NPC` -- **Conjure Sinistran Sorcerer** is not offered by any merchant and does not drop
- [ ] `WB_Con_Dremora5_Spell_ConjureWeepingDaedra_NPC` -- **Conjure Weeping Shade** is not offered by any merchant and does not drop
- [ ] `WB_Con_Curse2_Spell_AtronachMark` -- **Elemental Mark** is not offered by any merchant and does not drop
- [ ] `WB_Con_Dremora4_Spell_SixDemonBag` -- **Six Demon Bag** is not offered by any merchant and does not drop

**Note the inconsistency:** 12 tomes are withheld but only 14 of the matching scrolls are. 
`WB_C075_SixDemonBag`'s scroll is still in `ZP_Apoc_Scrolls`, so that summon *is* reachable, once,
from a scroll. Either sell the tome or pull the scroll -- it should not be half-in.
