# Triumvirate for Enderal -- spell test matrix

> **Generated** by `src/Triumvirate/tools/14-gen-test-matrix.ps1` from the Spriggit YAML. Do not
> hand-edit -- re-run it. Tick the boxes in a working copy or a PR comment.

Covers the **75 tome-taught spells** (15 per archetype), enumerated from the Book records'
`Teaches` links so the list cannot drift from the plugin. Produced for **WD-11..WD-15**;
distribution rows are WD-16's and packaging is WD-18's.

## Before you start

1. **Find the plugin's load-order index**: `help "Spell Tome: Aid" 0` -- the leading two hex
   digits. **If this returns nothing, stop**: the plugin is not loading (on Enderal that almost
   always means `HEDR` 1.71; this tree builds 1.70, so suspect the deploy).
2. **Test character**: `tgm`, `player.setav magicka 100000`, `player.setlevel 50`.
3. **Papyrus log on** (see CLAUDE.md -- the PROFILE ini, and the log lands in the Skyrim SE
   Documents folder). Any `Cannot call ... on a None object` line naming a `TVR_` script during
   these tests is a regression -- after WD-16 there is NO expected TVR Papyrus noise at all:
   the populate script was replaced and its dead calls removed.
4. Teach a spell with `player.additem <XX offset of the tome> 1` then read it, or
   `player.addspell`.

## Cross-cutting named risks

| OK | Risk | Why it cannot be proven from records |
|----|------|--------------------------------------|
| [ ] | **Wild Shape / `Game.SetBeastForm`** | Engine werewolf flag on a game with no werewolf system -- HUD, controls and equipment behaviour are unknowable until launch (WD-17 finding 4) |
| [ ] | **Raven summon rig** | The one summon with no close Enderal creature family; watch its skeleton/animation in flight |
| [ ] | **All four Shadow teleports indoors** | Navmesh and walkable-terrain checks differ per cell; Enderal's interiors were never the mod's test bed |
| [ ] | **Darkness detection under Enderal lighting** | Gather Shadows / Nightfall scale off ambient light; Enderal replaced all light settings (SureAI readme) |
| [ ] | **Fylgja possession lifecycle** | Save, load, fast travel, combat interruption while the body is left behind |
| [ ] | **Hurl Into Sinistra holding cell** | Survivors sit in TVR_Cell until recast; verify they return, and never cast it at a quest NPC |
| [ ] | **Aura release hooks** | Concentration-end triggers are runtime-only behaviour |
| [ ] | **Warlock Spirit-binding loop end to end** | Kill under Eldritch Blast -> summon within 30s -> upgraded minion (WD-13 done-when) |
| [ ] | **Totem placement on Enderal navmesh** | Placed activators with in-combat conditions |
| [ ] | **Sacred Hearth across sessions** | World marker must survive save/reload and not trap the player |

**Expected deviations (working as intended, do not file):** single summons only (Twin Souls
dead), base-strength Warlock minions (Elemental Potency dead), Possession never affects
Dwarven-keyword constructs (Master of the Mind dead), Farsight's travel-marker beams silent
(orphaned quest), Diviner/Farsight XP trickle absent (`AdvanceSkill` is inert in Enderal).
