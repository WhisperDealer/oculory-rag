# Triumvirate — Enderal gap audit

**Everything Triumvirate points at that Enderal does not have, or has as something else**, with the
record evidence beside each verdict. Produced for **WD-9**; every archetype story (WD-11…WD-15) and
the distribution rebuild (WD-16) scope off this.

Baseline census, kill-checks and the ingest findings are in
[`ingest-census.md`](ingest-census.md) — this document does not repeat them.

> **Method.** Absolute, not diff-based. A check that only reports what *we* newly broke reads zero
> forever while the mod ships thousands of inherited dead references — the lesson from
> [`../Apocalypse/enderal-gap-audit.md`](../apocalypse/enderal-gap-audit.md). Every reference is
> keyed by `<hex>:<master>` (never hex alone), resolved against Enderal's trees **and** against the
> real Bethesda masters, so "dead", "renamed" and "now a different record" are told apart rather
> than lumped together.

## Headline

| | |
|---|---|
| References examined | **11,289** |
| Resolve correctly in Enderal | **10,587 (94%)** |
| Dead — Enderal has nothing at that FormID | **702 occurrences, 311 distinct FormKeys, 149 records** |
| Survived but became a **different** record | **15 FormKeys** (1 retyped, 14 drifted) |
| Dead references that never existed in vanilla either | **0** — all 311 resolve in a real Bethesda master |

**Triumvirate ports far better than Apocalypse did.** The comparable Apocalypse figure was 4,077
dead occurrences across 617 FormKeys; this is 702 across 311, and the damage is concentrated in
distribution and in a handful of named mechanics rather than spread through the spell set.

Do **not** read the occurrence count as a severity ranking. 254 of the 702 are vendor leveled lists
that WD-16 replaces wholesale, while a single dead perk (`TwinSouls`) silently removes a headline
feature from two archetypes.

## Tooling

Three committed generators under `src/Triumvirate/tools/`, all re-runnable:

| Script | Answers | Output |
|---|---|---|
| `verify-missing-refs.ps1` | What does Enderal not have? | `build/dist/triumvirate-refs.csv` (every reference, classified) |
| `resolve-dead-refs.ps1` | What was each dead reference *meant* to be? | `build/dist/triumvirate-dead-refs.csv` |
| `verify-ref-drift.ps1` | Which surviving FormIDs became a **different** record? | `build/dist/triumvirate-ref-drift.csv` |

The last two need the **real** Bethesda masters serialized alongside Enderal's replacements:

```
reference/base/SkyrimReal        real Skyrim.esm       853,721 records   (vs Enderal's 792,831)
reference/base/UpdateReal        real Update.esm        14,032
reference/base/DawnguardReal     real Dawnguard.esm     93,218            (vs a 44 KB stub)
reference/base/HearthFiresReal   real HearthFires.esm   17,480            (vs an 80-byte stub)
reference/base/DragonbornReal    real Dragonborn.esm   176,956            (vs a 44 KB stub)
```

All five are gitignored and regenerable with `/spriggit-decompile-reference` from the Skyrim SE
install in `tools.json`. **This is the single highest-leverage thing this audit added**: without the
vanilla trees a dead FormID is an opaque hex string, and with them it is a named record you can pick
a substitute for. `DawnguardReal` fails Spriggit's own round-trip check on one LZ4-compressed NPC
record; the serialized tree is complete and correct for lookup, which is all it is used for.

## Verdicts

### 1. Spell tiering already works — do not touch it — **LEAVE**

The most important negative finding. Enderal reuses **all 25 vanilla school perks**
(`AlterationNovice00` … `RestorationMaster100`), and its own class talents read them through
`SpellHasCastingPerkConditionData` — the condition that asks *"is this spell's `HalfCostPerk` X?"*.

```yaml
# reference/base/Skyrim/Perks/_00E_Class_Thaumaturge_P02_MentalNovice - 069D00_Skyrim.esm.yaml
# "Reduces the Mana costs of mental and light spells of the novice and apprentice level by 30 percent."
- MutagenObjectType: PerkEntryPointModifyValue
  Conditions:
  - Conditions:
    - Data: { MutagenObjectType: SpellHasCastingPerkConditionData, Perk: 0F2CAA:Skyrim.esm }  # RestorationNovice00
    - Data: { MutagenObjectType: SpellHasCastingPerkConditionData, Perk: 0C44C7:Skyrim.esm }  # RestorationApprentice25
    - Data: { MutagenObjectType: SpellHasCastingPerkConditionData, Perk: 0F2CA6:Skyrim.esm }  # AlterationNovice00
    - Data: { MutagenObjectType: SpellHasCastingPerkConditionData, Perk: 0C44B7:Skyrim.esm }  # AlterationApprentice25
  EntryPoint: ModSpellCost
  Modification: Multiply
  Value: 0.7
```

**14 Enderal talent perks** across the Elementalist, Sinistrope, Thaumaturge and Affinity lines do
this, and between them they test **every one of the 25 vanilla tier perks**. All 126 of Triumvirate's
`HalfCostPerk` references resolve.

> **So a ported Skyrim spell's tier tag is not merely harmless — it is exactly the hook Enderal's
> talent system already reads.** Leave `HalfCostPerk` alone on every ported spell; setting it
> correctly is what makes an Enderal mage's talent discounts apply. This generalises to any ported
> magic mod and is worth revisiting for Apocalypse.

The five `MagicSkill` ActorValues are likewise kept and only renamed (CLAUDE.md, "The five magic
schools are renamed, not replaced"), so `GetActorValue`-style scaling reads a real value. Remember
the pairing that catches people out: **Alteration is Mentalism, Illusion is Psionics.**

### 2. Four dead perks — three cost a real mechanic — **FIX**

| Dead FormKey | Was | Refs | Costs |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `0D5F1C:Skyrim.esm` | **`TwinSouls`** | 13 | Every `*_TwinSouls` effect on the Druid's Raven / Hound of Hircine and the Warlock's demons — **the minion-doubling feature, in two archetypes** |
| `0CB41A:Skyrim.esm` | **`ElementalPotency`** | 10 | Dual-cast potency on Gremlin / Leviathan / Ravagor / Temple Grim summons |
| `059B76:Skyrim.esm` | **`MasterOfTheMind`** | 1 | `TVR_Shadow_Possess_Effect_TraitorousShadow` working on undead/daedra/automatons |
| `0177B4:Dragonborn.esm` | `DLC2AshShellDmgPerk` | 1 | Cosmetic, on the Shaman's Worldshatter ash-shell hazard |

Enderal replaced Skyrim's perk trees with its own talents, so there is no drop-in equivalent — these
must be rebuilt as Triumvirate-owned perks hung off Enderal talents, or the feature cut. Decide per
archetype in WD-11…WD-15; **`TwinSouls` is the one to decide first**, because "summon two" is a
selling point of both the Druid and the Warlock.

### 3. `MagicAllegianceFaction` is gone — Enderal has a direct archetype — **REPLACE**

`09E0C9:Skyrim.esm` `MagicAllegianceFaction` is dead, with **25 references** — one on every
`TVR_Ancestors_Actor_SpiritGuardian_*` (the Shaman's 25 per-race/sex ancestor summons). Nothing in
Enderal references it.

Enderal's own summons use **`Creature__SummonableFaction` `046E6B:Skyrim.esm`** instead:

```yaml
FormKey: 046E6B:Skyrim.esm
EditorID: Creature__SummonableFaction
Flags: [HiddenFromPC]
CrimeValues: { Arrest: True, AttackOnSight: True }
```

**60 Enderal actors are in it** — the `_NNE_Summonable*_Player` / `_NPC` pairs (Ghostly Wolf,
Skeleton, the four elementals, Oorbaya…). That is the proven archetype; use it rather than
recreating Bethesda's faction. Note the Enderal naming convention while you are there:
`_<level>E_Summonable<Creature>_Player`, with a separate `_NPC` variant — worth matching in
WD-11…WD-15.

Also dead and animal-summon related: `PredatorFaction 02E893` (4 refs — Wolf, Snow Leopard, the two
Fylgja) and `PreyFaction 02E894` (2 refs — the Raven).

### 4. The Cleric's Dawnguard dependency is cosmetic only — **DROP the fields**

The ticket flagged the Cleric's sun damage and anti-undead multipliers as Dawnguard-dependent. They
are not. Everything the Cleric loses to Dawnguard is a visual:

| Dead | Was | Refs | Field |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `00A3BB:Dawnguard.esm` | `DLC1SunFireFXShader` | 5 | `HitShader` |
| `019C9E:Dawnguard.esm` | `DLC1SunDamageImpactSmoke` | 2 | condition `Object` |
| `00AE9D:Dawnguard.esm` | `DLCAurielsBowEffectImod` | 1 | `ImageSpaceModifier` |

The mechanic itself is Triumvirate's own and works: `TVR_Cleric_Auras_Effect_Aura_1_CloakProc_VsUndead`
gates on `IsHostileToActorConditionData` plus keyword tests, and **`ActorTypeUndead 013796`,
`ActorTypeAnimal 013798` and `ActorTypeDaedra 013797` all exist in Enderal and are actively used —
by 197, 70 and 24 NPC/Race records respectively.** So the anti-undead multiplier fires on Enderal's
Lost Ones with no change.

Drop the three visual fields or substitute an Enderal shader. Do not invent a mechanism.

### 5. Distribution is completely inert — **REPLACE (WD-16)**

Same shape as Apocalypse, and just as dead. `TVR_PopulateSpellBooks2_Quest` (`StartGameEnabled` +
`RunOnce`) carries a `TVR_PopulateSpellBooks_Script` with **90 script object properties**: 44 are
Triumvirate's own and live; **46 point at Bethesda records, of which 36 are dead** — 11 named Skyrim
NPCs (Danica Pure-Spring, Dravynea, Froki, Hamal, Jora, Maramal, Nura, Rorlund, Runil), 22
`LItemStaff*` leveled lists, `JobMerchantFaction`, and the DLC chests.

The dead vendor economy behind it, by occurrence: `PerkMasterTraderGold` (26), `VendorGoldSpells`
(15), `LItemSpellVendorScrolls75` (15), the `LItemApothecary*75` family (~40 across 6 lists),
`LItemSpellTomes00/25All*` per school. **92 dead LeveledItems in 254 occurrences** — 36% of all dead
references.

> **The remaining 10 are worse than dead: they bind to Enderal scenery.** Ten of the quest's
> properties resolve in Enderal only as *placed references* — the FormID survived as an unrelated
> object. Two confirmed by reading the cell:
>
> | Property | FormID | In Enderal |
> |---|---|---|
> | `MerchantWCollegeEnthirChest` | `0EE9F8` | a `PlacedObject` (base `03E229`) in **UndercityBarracksHiddenWalkway** |
> | `MerchantDBSanctuaryMerchantChest` | `0ABD9F` | a `PlacedObject` (base `0BC9CE`) in **AgnodLevel01Engine** |
>
> A Papyrus `ObjectReference` property binds successfully here, because the reference exists — it is
> simply the wrong object. Whether `AddItem` on it no-ops or errors is a **WD-17** question to answer
> by reading the script, not to assume. Either way the tomes never reach a merchant.
>
> CLAUDE.md's rule from Apocalypse applies: **make the work empty rather than trying to stop the
> script**, and `grep` the whole script set for the symbol first — Apocalypse had a second entry
> point (an MCM "Repopulate" button) driving the same loop over duplicate lists.

Triumvirate also ships **14 merchant-chest overrides and 6 `Services*` faction overrides** for Skyrim
vendors that do not exist here, plus its own `TVR_*_Container_Merchant*Chest` records keyed to the
same absent NPCs. WD-16 rehomes all of it onto Enderal's merchants; Enderal's own spell-book lists
and the merchant wealth ladder are tabulated in CLAUDE.md.

#### The skill-tier globals

**[verified 2026-08-26 — found after WD-16 shipped, fixed in WD-16b.]** Rehoming the tomes onto
live merchants was necessary and **not sufficient**. 45 of the 75 were still unobtainable, because
Enai's Adept/Expert/Master tier bundles carry vanilla Skyrim's own spell-tome gate:

```yaml
# TVR_Tomes_Litem_Druid_050_Alteration - 438210
ChanceNone: 1
Global: 0F2584:Skyrim.esm      # PCAlterationAdept
```

When a `LeveledItem` names a `Global`, **that global's value is the chance-none percentage** — the
`ChanceNone` byte beside it is ignored. In Enderal all 15 `PC<School><Adept|Expert|Master>` globals
read `Data: 100`, i.e. a 100% chance of yielding nothing, and **nothing in the game ever lowers
them**:

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Who zeroes them in vanilla | `WISkillIncrease02.psc`, on skill increase |
| Is that quest in Enderal? | **No** — `WISkillIncrease01/02` exist in `reference/base/SkyrimReal/Quests/` and in **neither** `reference/base/Skyrim/Quests/` nor FS |
| Is the script in Enderal's tree? | **No** — absent from `reference/base/EnderalScripts/` |
| Anything else referencing them? | **No** — across Enderal's whole serialized tree the only file matching `0F2584:Skyrim.esm` is the global's own record |

So the globals are inert leftovers sitting at their unopened default, and every Adept-and-above
tome sat behind a 100% chance-none. The fix is to delete the `Global:` line and let Enai's authored
`ChanceNone: 1` stand.

> **Why WD-16's own proof missed it.** `15-distribution.ps1` walks the chest → bundle → tier-bundle
> → tome chain and asserts every tome is reachable. That walk is **structural** — it reads
> `Reference:` and never looks at `ChanceNone` or `Global`, so it reported a confident *"75/75 tomes
> at >=3 vendors"* on a mod that could actually sell 30. A reachability check that ignores the
> fields controlling whether a list yields is not a reachability check. `17-tier-gating.ps1`'s
> verifier reads both.
>
> **Generalise it: on any ported Skyrim spell mod, grep the leveled lists for `Global:` before
> trusting distribution.** This is a second instance of the CLAUDE.md pattern — a surviving vanilla
> FormID that is *present* but semantically inert — and it is invisible to a missing-reference
> audit, because `PCAlterationAdept` resolves perfectly well. It just never changes.

### 6. FormIDs that survived as a *different* record — **the live-bug class**

15 of 1,462 distinct surviving `:Skyrim.esm` references are not the record Bethesda had. 1,402 are
exact `MATCH`, which is why these stand out.

**RETYPED — a different record type entirely (1):**

| FormKey | Vanilla | Enderal |
|---|---|---|
| `041449` | `Regions/TundraMegan01` | **`Statics/_00E_Ark_1024WallRound01`** |

This is inside Triumvirate's `Tamriel 00003C` worldspace override — the same FormID CLAUDE.md already
records from Apocalypse. It disappears when that override is dropped (see ingest-census finding 1).

**DRIFTED — same type, unrelated record (14).** Most are harmless or accidentally right:

| FormKey | Vanilla | Enderal | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| `10E93B` `10E99A` `10EE3F` `10EE64` `10FC0F` | `MineOreBlackreach01–04` | `_00E_MineOreShadowsteel*` | **LEAVE — accidentally correct.** The Druid's Mark Ore list wanted ore veins and Enderal put ore veins at those IDs |
| `09748B` `07EE00` | `GlowingMushroom*` | `_00E_Mistshroom*` | **LEAVE** — still a mushroom |
| `0BB94D` `0BB94E` | `TreeFloraDragonsTongue01/02` | `TreeFloraVatyrsTongue01/02` | **LEAVE** — Enderal's rename of the same plant |
| `013AE6` `0AA8D3` | `MaleNord`, `MaleGuard` | `VT_Male_Merchant_Old`, `VT_Male_OrderGuard01` | **LEAVE** — still voice types; a summon gets an Enderal voice |
| `0516C8` | `deathBell` | `BaldrisRoot` | **LEAVE** — ingredient for ingredient, in a chest WD-16 replaces |
| `092A6C` | an art-attach named node | **`SomeWolfKeyword`** | **READ IT.** In the Keywords list of `TVR_Primal_Race_CallWolf` (where it is accidentally apt) *and* `TVR_Warrior_Race_Fylgja` (where it is not) |
| **`0C891B`** | **`ReligiousMaraLove`** (Amulet of Mara) | **`_04E_30_Unique_SongOfTheWinter`** | **FIX.** An `Item` in `TVR_Cleric_Container_MerchantMaramalChest` |

> **`0C891B` is the third mod in this workspace to hit that exact FormID.** CLAUDE.md documents it
> from Biggie Traits, where the Amulet-of-the-Divines OR-group resolved it to that same Enderal
> unique weapon and fired Divine-amulet effects on it. Here the blast radius is small — the container
> belongs to a merchant Enderal does not have and WD-16 deletes it — but the pattern is now proven
> three times over: **a `:Skyrim.esm` FormID that resolves is not thereby correct.**

### 7. DLC masters — verdicts (moved here from WD-8)

260 references, 136 distinct FormKeys, 53 files. Every one now has a vanilla name, so each gets a
verdict rather than a guess.

| Shape | Count | Verdict |
|---|---:|---|
| Whole records overriding a DLC record — 5 DLC vendor chests + `DLC2dunFrostmoonWerewolvesVendorFaction` | 6 records | **DELETE.** They override records Enderal does not have; WD-16 replaces the distribution |
| Hearthfires garden plants and Dawnguard/Dragonborn flora — `BYOHHouseFloraCabbage01`, `BYOHButterChurn`, `DLC1TreeFloraMountainFlower*`, `DLC01Gleamblossom01old`… behind `TVR_Veil_FormList_Mark_Plant`, `…Mark_Ore`, `TVR_Verdant_FormList_Ingredients` | ~120 entries | **DROP the entries, then repopulate from Enderal's own flora.** Deleting alone leaves the Druid tracking a shorter list; the Blackreach→Shadowsteel drift above shows Enderal has real targets to point at. Mind the emptying trap: an empty collection means deleting the key, not leaving `Items:` bare |
| Single fields on Triumvirate's own records — `CrGargoyleVoice` (3), `CrDogDeathHound` (3), `DLC2EncClassDeathhound` (2), `DLC1csChaurusHunter` (1), the three Cleric sun visuals (8), Leviathan `Race`/`MorphRace`/`ArmorRace` → `DLC2MiraakRace`… | ~55 | **SUBSTITUTE per record**, from Enderal's bestiary. Never blanket-null: CLAUDE.md is explicit that a dangling FormID is proven harmless here while a null is not automatically better, and null `BNAM` on a `COBJ` was shipped once on exactly that untested reasoning |

Once those land, the three DLC masters come off the plugin and WD-18's gate is satisfiable.

### 8. The four Skyrim cells and their contents — **DELETE**

`RiftenHouseofClanSnowShod 016BDE`, `MarkarthTempleofDibella 016DF3`,
`SolitudeTempleoftheDivines 016A02` and exterior `Riverwood 009732` do not exist in Enderal, so
Triumvirate's overrides *inject* four Skyrim cells. Their supporting references are dead too —
`RiverwoodLocation`, `MarkarthTempleofDibellaLocation`,
`SolitudeTempleoftheEightDivinesLocation`, `RiftenHouseofClanSnowShodLocation`, and the `WETravel` /
`WESceneCenter` `LocationReferenceTypes` (8 refs each).

Delete the cell overrides, the worldspace override, and the 13 `REFR` / 4 `ACHR` that live in them.
Triumvirate's own `TVR_Cell 2E99EB` stays — it is the Night Gate portal interior and is self-contained.

## Applied

The verdicts above are implemented by six numbered generators in `src/Triumvirate/tools/`, run in
order. Each asserts what it changed and refuses to proceed on a silent no-op.

| Step | Does |
|---|---|
| `01-drop-skyrim-cells.ps1` | Deletes the `Tamriel` worldspace and the four cell overrides Enderal lacks, then prunes the orphaned CELL block folders — Spriggit leaves a `GroupRecordData.yaml` behind, which would serialize as an empty GRUP |
| `02-drop-dlc-override-records.ps1` | Deletes the six whole-record DLC overrides |
| `03-strip-dlc-list-entries.ps1` | Removes 185 bare DLC list entries across 8 records |
| `04-substitute-dlc-fields.ps1` | 35 field substitutions, 3 field removals, 10 sequence-item removals |
| `05-drop-dlc-masters.ps1` | Drops the three DLC masters — refuses to run while any DLC reference survives |
| `06-fix-drifted-refs.ps1` | The two drifted references worth fixing |

### Result

| | Before | After |
|---|---:|---:|
| References examined | 11,289 | 10,961 |
| **Dead occurrences** | **702** | **391** |
| Distinct dead FormKeys | 311 | 154 |
| Records holding a dead reference | 149 | 101 |
| **References into a DLC** | **260** | **0** |
| **RETYPED** (wrong record type) | 1 | **0** |
| **DRIFTED** (wrong record) | 14 | **12**, all deliberate LEAVEs |
| Masters | 5 | **`Skyrim.esm`, `Update.esm`** |
| Form version | 1.70 | **1.70** |

The rebuilt plugin drops from 1882 records to **1866 — exactly the 16 intended**, with **nothing
added and no type mismatches**, verified by an index-shift-aware census (the mod index moves 05 → 02
when three masters go, so a naive FormID diff reports all 1882 records as changed):

```
REMOVED (16):                              ADDED (0): none
  00003C WRLD   Tamriel                    type mismatches: 0
  000D74 CELL   Tamriel's persistent cell
  009732 CELL   Riverwood
  016A02 016BDE 016DF3  CELL   the three temple/house interiors
  0198A5 019DCC 01E766 1066DF  ACHR  the placed vendor NPCs inside them
  00F82B 0177C1 01DC65 01F88D 01F897  CONT   the DLC vendor chests
  01DC62 FACT   DLC2dunFrostmoonWerewolvesVendorFaction
```

Everything still dead is `Skyrim.esm` (390 occurrences) plus one `Update.esm`, and it is
concentrated where the remaining tickets already point: `Item` 215 and `Faction`/`MerchantContainer`
31 (WD-16), `Perk` 23 (WD-11…WD-15), `Object` 43 (mostly the populate quest), `Template` 8 and
`LocationReferenceType` 16.

### One casualty to carry into WD-11

**`TVR_Verdant_FormList_Ingredients` is now empty.** All 36 of its entries were Hearthfires garden
plants, so stripping the DLC took the whole list. The Druid's Druidcraft ingredient mechanic has
nothing to find until WD-11 repopulates it from Enderal's own flora. The list is a legal empty
FormList — Spriggit drops the `Items:` key entirely, which is the required shape — so it builds and
does nothing, rather than failing.

Two neighbours shrank but survived: `TVR_Veil_FormList_Mark_Plant` 170 → 112 and
`TVR_Elemental_FormList_ControlFlames_FireSources` 101 → 87. `TVR_Veil_FormList_Mark_Ore` lost 6 of
567 and still resolves against Enderal's shadowsteel veins.

### Flagged for WD-17 while applying

`TVR_Shaman_Violence_Effect_Worldshatter_Hazard_AshShell` runs **`DLC2AshShellScript`** — Bethesda's
Dragonborn script, not one of Triumvirate's. Its dead `DLC2AshShellDmgPerk` property is gone, but
whether the BSA ships a copy of the script itself is unknown until an extractor is configured.

## Not yet swept

Stated plainly rather than left implied:

* **Script internals.** `TVR_PopulateSpellBooks_Script` and the 96 `tvr_*` archetype scripts have
  not been decompiled, so every claim here about *runtime* behaviour is bounded by what the records
  show. The `.pex` are extractable now — see the asset sweep below. **WD-17.**
* **Per-summon actor mapping.** Which of the ~15 summons has a usable Enderal base actor is scoped
  but not decided; the faction, voice and class substitutes above are the framework.
  **WD-11…WD-15.**

## Asset sweep — the BSA overwrites two of Enderal's own scripts

**Done, and it found the defect it was looking for.** `bsab` and `champollion` are now wired into
`tools.json`, so this is reproducible in one command.

Triumvirate ships two archives: 334 files in `Triumvirate - Mage Archetypes.bsa` (107 scripts, ~225
meshes/sounds) and 133 in the Textures BSA.

### The script collision

Intersecting the BSA's 107 script names with Enderal's own 5031 gives **exactly two**, and they are
the two CLAUDE.md already names as Enderal's deliberate stubs:

| Script | Enderal's version | What the BSA ships |
|---|---|---|
| `dgintimidateplayerscript` | 4 lines, `; DUMMY, DO NOTHING` | 2425 bytes — **59 lines decompiled**, the full vanilla brawl script |
| `dgintimidatealiasscript` | 4 lines, `; DUMMY, DO NOTHING` | 1983 bytes — **47 lines decompiled**, the full vanilla alias script |

Both decompile with a Champollion header reading `User: Maximilian` and a 2016 compile date — the
Brawl Bugs Patch. `dgintimidatealiasscript` reaches for `DGIntimidateFaction`, which Enderal lacks.
Triumvirate loads after Enderal, so **its BSA wins and Skyrim's brawl system comes back on a game
that removed it**.

**This is the second Enai Siaion mod in this workspace to ship exactly this.** Apocalypse did the
same, for the same reason. Treat it as expected of any Enairim port rather than as a surprise.

**Fixed** the way Apocalypse fixed it: `src/Triumvirate/Scripts/` re-ships **Enderal's own stubs**,
loose, because loose files beat any BSA. Compiled with Enderal's tree first on `-i` — the results
are **480 and 482 bytes, byte-identical to Apocalypse's**, which is the cheapest possible proof the
import order was right (vanilla's copy compiles to ~2 KB). Consequence for the mod page: **this mod
must sit after Triumvirate in MO2's file priority**, which it already must in order to win the
`.esp`.

Seven further Bethesda scripts ride along — `bladessparringscript`, `c00trainerscript`,
`c00vilkasscript`, the two Jorrvaskr fight scripts, `companionssinglecombatantscript`,
`ms11calixtoscript`. All seven are vanilla, **none collides with an Enderal script name**, and
Enderal has no Companions to attach them. Inert clutter; left alone.

### Non-script assets

Meshes, sounds and textures are almost entirely namespaced (`meshes\triumvirate\`,
`meshes\mihail monsters and animals\`, `meshes\apocnew\`, `textures\triumvirate\`,
`sound\fx\<esp>\`), so they cannot collide. Four files sit outside a namespace, and only two of
those actually overlap Enderal:

| File | Verdict |
|---|---|
| `textures\architecture\riften\riftenrope01.dds` and `_n.dds` | **Overwrites Enderal's copies** — both exist in `Skyrim - Textures1.bsa` and Enderal does not override them. Cosmetic: a rope texture changes wherever Enderal reuses it. **LEAVE**, note on the mod page |
| `textures\effects\gradients\mihailvoriplasmgrad.dds`, `mihailwillothewispgrad.dds` | Mihail's own; **no** Enderal file at either path. No collision |

### Reproduce

```bash
bsab -l:N "<mod>.bsa" -f "scripts\*" | sed 's/\.pex$//' | tr A-Z a-z | sort -u > bsa.txt
ls reference/base/EnderalScripts/source/scripts/ | sed 's/\.psc$//' | tr A-Z a-z | sort -u > enderal.txt
comm -12 bsa.txt enderal.txt          # any output is an Enderal script the mod overwrites
```

`bsab`'s list output has a trailing blank line — filter with `grep -c .`, not `wc -l`, or every
archive reports one phantom hit.

## The archetype passes (WD-11..WD-15)

Applied 2026-08-24 by generators `08`-`13` in `src/Triumvirate/tools/`, after regenerating the
audit CSVs against the post-WD-9 tree. Result: **391 -> 293 dead occurrences (-98, the exact sum
of the fixes below)**, and the built plugin is 1.70 / EnderalSE and deserializes clean.

### Fixed (98 occurrences)

| Fix | Occ | Why this substitute |
|---|---:|---|
| `MagicAllegianceFaction 09E0C9` -> `Creature__SummonableFaction 046E6B` | 25 | Enderal's own player summons carry exactly this one faction (read off `_05E_SummonableGhostlyWolf_Player`). Covers 20 SpiritGuardian actors, 2 `AddToFaction` script properties, 2 faction relations, 1 quest-alias faction |
| 8 staves' `Template: StaffTemplateIIllusion 07A91B` -> `StaffTemplateConjuration 07E647` | 8 | Enderal keeps five staff templates and its own staves template to the surviving one for their school (`_00E_StaffOfTheOorbaya` -> `07E647`). Illusion = Psionics, a Sinistra school like Entropy |
| `SayOnHitByMagicEffectScript` removed from 3 effects | 3 | Their `TopicToSay` pointed at `WICastMagicNonHostileSpell*` topics; Enderal has **no** WICastMagic topics at all. GrandHealing subspell lost its whole VMAD (only script); Suggestion/Obedience keep their own scripts |
| Aura cloak-proc guard exclusion `086EEE` -> `IsGuardFaction 07286D` | 2 | Enderal has its own IsGuardFaction at a different ID - the exclusion is repointed, not lost |
| `PredatorFaction`/`PreyFaction` stripped (5 NPCs + 1 alias condition) | 6 | No Enderal equivalent (creature factions are per-species). The TrackEnemies condition only excluded prey; `IsHostileToActor` on the same alias already does |
| Conversion quest bow/arrow -> `_01E_01_HuntingBow 015C39` / `_01E_05_IronArrow 0457D8` | 2 | Enderal's own basic hunting kit |
| `MG01` VMAD property removed (ControlFlames) | 1 | Vanilla College quest; unfilled property is None either way |
| Shield of Awe release-sound condition removed | 1 | Gated on `GetGlobalValue CWDistantCatapultsAMB == 1`, dead here - the master spell's release sound **never played**. The .wavs are vanilla and ship in `Skyrim - Sounds.bsa` |
| Dead list entries pruned (Mark lists 28, fire sources 11, chargen presets 10, voice types 1) | 50 | Inert `<list entry>` references; pruned so the audit stays readable |

Plus one **repopulation**: `TVR_Verdant_FormList_Ingredients` (emptied by the WD-9 DLC strip)
now holds **24 Enderal wild plants** - herbs, flowers and mushrooms verified in
`reference/base/Skyrim/{Florae,Trees}` with English names and ingredient yields - so Druidcraft
grows something again. Wild herbs rather than the original's Hearthfires garden vegetables: a
corpse feeding the wild is the spell's own fiction.

### Deliberate leaves (40 occurrences, all graceful)

| Left dead | Occ | Why leaving is correct |
|---|---:|---|
| `TwinSouls 0D5F1C` (12 effect conditions + manager quest property) | 13 | The single-summon base variants carry `HasPerk == 0` conditions - TRUE forever with the perk dead - so the base path always fires. Enderal has no two-summons perk to repoint at (Sinistrope line checked). **Minion doubling is absent by design** |
| `ElementalPotency 0CB41A` (10 Conjure effect conditions) | 10 | Same shape: base variants always fire, `_Potent` never. `Sinistrope: Mystical Binding` is summoned *weapons*, not summons - no equivalent |
| `MasterOfTheMind 059B76` (Possession) | 1 | The OR-group collapses to "not a Dwarven-keyword construct" - vanilla's no-perk behaviour exactly |
| `TVR_Stone_Quest_Mark`'s `WETravel`/`WESceneCenter` LocationReferenceTypes | 16 | The quest is not StartGameEnabled and **nothing references it** - records or scripts. Enai's orphaned dev content, like `TVR_Diviner_FormList_Mark_Gold_UNUSED_ATM` |

The remaining **253** dead occurrences were WD-16's distribution surface, and the WD-16 rebuild
removed them all: the 14 vanilla merchant-chest overrides, the 6 vanilla vendor-faction
overrides, the 8 satellite chests and 9 satellite factions are deleted, the populate quest's 76
dead calls are gone with its replacement script, and distribution now runs through ten Enderal
merchant chest overrides (see [`vendor-mapping.md`](vendor-mapping.md)). **The audit now reads
40 dead occurrences - exactly the deliberate leaves above - and the plugin overrides nothing of
any master except the ten chests.**

### Findings that closed ticket questions without edits

* **Sun damage (WD-14/WD-15) was already solved.** The "fire and sun" spells are plain fire
  (`ResistValue: ResistFire`) plus `_VsUndead` doubling effects gated on
  `HasKeyword ActorTypeUndead == 1 OR IsUndead == 1`. `ActorTypeUndead 013796` **exists** in
  Enderal, and `IsUndead` reads race flags - the Lost Ones sit on `DraugrRace` shells, so the
  anti-undead doubling fires. No Dawnguard machinery survives in these records.
* **Spirit Guardian races (WD-14) degrade gracefully.** `TVR_ProjectedSpirit_Script` does
  `TVR_Races.find(GetRace())` and falls back to index 0 on no match - every Enderal race gets a
  guardian. The Argonian/Khajiit/Orc guardians are unreachable (no Enderal player has those
  races) and stay as vestigial records rather than being deleted.
* **The Hurl Into Sinistra holding cell is the mod's own** (`TVR_Cell 2E99EB`) - nothing to
  repoint, only a WD-18 stranding test.
* **The Fylgjas' granted spells** (Winter's Howl, Crystalize, Sun Flare, Grand Healing) are all
  Triumvirate's own subspell copies and resolve.

### Renames applied (naming-table decisions, settled)

Per `naming-table.md`: Hircine -> no patron (*Call the Glacier Hound*, *Mark of the Wild*),
*Azra's Wrath* -> *Shadow's Wrath*, *Hurl Into Oblivion* -> *Hurl Into Sinistra* (descriptions
follow), *Eye of the All-Maker* -> *Eye of the Ancestors*, *Staff of Earth Bones* -> *Staff of
Fissures*, and the Cleric's Aid buff names now read Enderal's skill display names (Mentalism,
Entropy, Elementalism, Psionics, Light Magic, Handicraft, Rhetoric, Sleight of Hand...). Display
strings only; EditorIDs and asset paths are identifiers and stay. The WD-10 close-out grep runs
over the finished tree after WD-16.

## How to reproduce

```powershell
powershell -File src/Triumvirate/tools/verify-missing-refs.ps1   # -> triumvirate-refs.csv
powershell -File src/Triumvirate/tools/resolve-dead-refs.ps1     # -> triumvirate-dead-refs.csv
powershell -File src/Triumvirate/tools/verify-ref-drift.ps1      # -> triumvirate-ref-drift.csv
```

The first runs against Enderal's trees alone. The other two need `reference/base/*Real`; serialize
them once with `/spriggit-decompile-reference` against the Skyrim SE install named in `tools.json`.

Once the verdicts above are applied, re-run the first with `-Baseline <n>` to ratchet the dead-
reference count down and hold it.
